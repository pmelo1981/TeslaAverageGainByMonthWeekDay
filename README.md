## One day I feasted my eyes on this image:

So I said I should regenerate this from first principles, but for TSLA<br>

Backup image in case it goes down: <a href="./snp_february_weak_for_stocks.png">./snp_february_weak_for_stocks.png</a><br>

Data file stored locally as 'tsla.csv'<br>

## Which Programming Language should I select for this charting job?

Brainstorming, It's a histogram, and based on my experience, 6 languages can do this, but python wins.

1.  Python's matplotlib, second to none and lots of examples.
2.  R's ggplot2, designed for statistics and data analysis.
3.  Javascript D3js 3rd party graphing plugin with every chart variation under the sun.
4.  Gnu Octave 2D and 3D charting for matrix operations.
5.  Bash gnuplot, do it for Tux.
6.  Java Jfreechart.  Just no.

Reason being that although python is an overall shitty language, in matplotlib data analysis
and library support for financial charting is second to none.  Also there's a book on my shelf: 
"Python for finance" so there's that.
